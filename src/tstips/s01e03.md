Typing is great! I guess we can all agree with that, but sometimes we would like to reuse a few types, by composing multiple small types into a big one, or telling how should a function behave in case it gets a different number of parameters, you name it, this section is focused on juggling multiple type definitions in order to achieve the desired outcome.

## extends

One interface can `extend` another. It's the inheritance equivalent for types.

In sum, the extending class will have all the properties of the extended class, and you can overwrite these properties, but only to a sub-type of the extended type, and, of course, you can add new properties.

```js
interface Animal {
  name: string
  isRodent: boolean
  eat: string
}

interface Squirrel extends Animal {
  isRodent: true // 👍🏻 that's ok, true is a sub type of boolean
  isAdult: boolean // 👍🏻 it's ok, new properties are allowed
  eat: number // 💣💥 number is not a subtype of string
// 👆🏻 Interface 'Squirrel' incorrectly extends interface 'Animal'.
// Types of property 'eat' are incompatible.
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.ts(2430)
}

const sqrl: Squirrel = getSquirrel()

sqrl.isRodent // 👍🏻 this will always be compiled to true
sqrl.isAdult // 👍🏻 created new prop
sqrl.name // 👍🏻 even if not mentioned in Squirrel definition
// it exists because of the Animal definition
```

The same interface can `extend` multiple other interfaces, as long as they don't have clashing properties:

```js
interface FourLegged {
  legs: 4;
}

interface Rodent {
  isRodent: true;
}

interface Squirrel extends FourLegged, Rodent {
  isAdult: boolean; // 👍🏻 FourLegged and Rodent have no clashing properties
  // Squirrel will end up with 3 properties:
  // legs: 4; isRodent: true; isAdult: boolean
}
```

But if you try to do:

```js
interface Animal {
  isRodent: boolean
  legs: number
}

interface Rodent {
  isRodent: true
}

interface Squirrel extends Animal, Rodent {
  isAdult: boolean // 💣💥 The compiler will not know the interfaces precedence,
  // so you can't overwrite types, even with subtypes
  // 👆🏻 Interface 'Squirrel' cannot simultaneously extend types 'Animal' and 'Rodent'.
  // Named property 'isRodent' of types 'Animal' and 'Rodent' are not identical.ts(2320)
}
```

But in this case, we know all Rodents are Animals, so we can tell the compiler to precedence order by doing:

```js
interface Animal {
  isRodent: boolean
  legs: number
}

interface Rodent extends Animal {
  isRodent: true
}

interface Squirrel extends Rodent {
  isAdult: boolean // 👍🏻💪🏻 Great Success
}
```

If you do need to overwrite a prop with a totally different type, chances are, you've been making some poor decisions on your data modelling and might be a good idea to rethink the structure, BUT if you really need to, you can extend a generated type by the [Omitting](/ts/s01e01#pick-and-omit) a few props.

## overloads

"JavaScript is inherently a very dynamic language. It’s not uncommon for a single JavaScript function to return different types of objects based on the shape of the arguments passed in." -- Handbook

You have probably already clicked a package function while working on a IDE to go to it's definition, and most likely it looks like this:

```js
// @types/ramda/index.d.ts
export function map<T, U>(fn: (x: T) => U, list: readonly T[]): U[];
export function map<T, U>(fn: (x: T) => U): (list: readonly T[]) => U[];
export function map<T, U>(fn: (x: T[keyof T & keyof U]) => U[keyof T & keyof U], list: T): U;
export function map<T, U>(fn: (x: T[keyof T & keyof U]) => U[keyof T & keyof U]): (list: T) => U;
export function map<T, U>(fn: (x: T) => U, obj: Functor<T>): Functor<U>; // used in functors
export function map<T, U>(fn: (x: T) => U): (obj: Functor<T>) => Functor<U>; // used in functors
```

The same function is "defined" more than once with a different number/shape of parameters. And that's okay for typescript, even though javascript will not accept more than one function **logic definition**, you can write more than one function **type declaration**.

And the compiler will go through all of them, **from top to bottom**, trying to match your usage of that function in order to infer the ReturnType.

In other words, the **order does matter** and you should go from specific to generic in order to avoid an "early generic match".

```js
interface GenericFirst {
  (p: any): any
  (p: string): string
}

interface SpecificFirst {
  (p: string): string
  (p: any): any
}

const genFirst: GenericFirst = p => p

const specFirst: SpecificFirst = p => p

const n = genFirst('string') // n evaluates to any
const s = specFirst('string') // s evaluates to string
```

There are multiple ways to declare overloads, this was the interface approach, but on the handbook you will find the function approach, and the are others.

As seen above, [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) uses A LOT of overloads because basically all their functions are curried, so if a function is expecting 3 params and only receives 1 it will return a function that is expecting 2, and all the possible sub group combinations of N params for all their functions 😂 it's a lot of overloads, and works amazingly well. 👏🏻 Good job Ramda people. 🎉

Even though it's not totally recommended by the REST spec, it's very common to see APIs that either accepts an extra parameter that will convert the response from a mapped object to an array, or to have an input, like an id lookup, that if receives a string (single ID), the API will respond that id match, but if receives an array with IDs, the API will respond an array with all id matches.

And that's another case where overloads can shine.

```js
type ConvertableMethod<P extends ConvertableParams> = {
  (p: Omit<P, 'key_by_type'> & { key_by_type: true }): MethodResponse<StreamSetObj>
  (p: P): MethodResponse<StreamSetArr>
}
```

[Strava Streams API][strava-streams-api]

If `key_by_type` param is true, the API respond with a mapped object, otherwise with an Array.

## union and intersection

Unions and intersections can be super handy if used right. But they have a few caveats that I will try to explore here.

[Union][union-handbook] (`|` operator)

From the "consumer" side of the API, you can face Unions as **OR** statements

```js
function draw(shape: Circle | Square) {
  ...
}

const circle: Circle = getCircle()

const square: Square = getSquare()

const triangle: Triangle = getTriangle()

draw(circle) // 👍🏻 circle is of type Circle OR Square
draw(square) // 👍🏻 square is of type Circle OR Square
draw(triangle) // 💣💥 triangle is neither a Circle OR a Square
// 👆🏻 Argument of type 'Triangle' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Circle | Square'.
```

so far so good, but the tricky part of Unions is handling the data that is of Union type, the "provider" side of the API

```js
interface Circle {
  radius: number
  area: number
}

interface Square {
  side: number
  area: number
}
function draw(shape: Circle | Square) {
  console.log(`My area is ${shape.area}`) // 👍🏻
  console.log(`My dimension is ${shape.radius || shape.side}`) // 💣💥
  // 👆🏻 Property 'side' does not exist on type 'Circle | Square'.
  // Property 'side' does not exist on type 'Circle'.ts(2339)
  // Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Circle | Square'.
  // Property 'radius' does not exist on type 'Square'.ts(2339)
}
```

Even though the above is a valid JS code and would work, the TS compiler is trying to prevent you from doing a mistake by accessing a maybe undefined value.

You can't know if the shape contains a radius OR a side and the compiler can't know they are "equivalent" props from each type, so it just forbids you to access them all the same.

If you need to access them you would have to rely on methods such as [Type Guards](/ts/s01e02#type-guards) or hardcoded cast types:

```js
function draw(shape: Circle | Square) {
  console.log(`My area is ${shape.area}`) // 👍🏻
  console.log(`My dimension is ${(shape as Circle).radius || (shape as Square).side}`) // 👍🏻
}
```

And that's what is the most confusing part about Unions, even though they are, per definition, Unions, one might say, in this "provider" context they behave like an intersection, because you can only "naturally" access the props defined by both. 🤔 It takes some getting used to it, take a deep breath 🧘🏻‍♀️ and let's check the REAL intersection.

[Intersection][intersection-handbook] (`&` operator)

Intersections work very similarly to [interface extensions](/ts/s01e03#extends), which means the resulting type will have **all properties from both intersected types** combined. Which can be a bit misleading in mathematical terms, because it does feel like a `Mathematical Union` if you ask me 😅 but don't let the terms confuse you.

```js
type Combined = { a: number } & { b: string }
const comb1: Combined = { a: 1 } // 💣💥
// 👆🏻 Type '{ a: number; }' is not assignable to type 'Combined'.
// Property 'b' is missing in type '{ a: number; }' but required in type '{ b: string; }'.ts(2322)
const comb2: Combined = { a: 1, b: 'Marcelo' } // 👍🏻
```

**but but but**, you might remember that [extensions](/ts/s01e03#extends) will throw if you have conflicting types, well, that's just not true about intersections, and even though the documentation says:

```
Intersection and union are recursive in case of conflicts
```

It does not make the problem about it explicit, in other words:

```js
type Conflicting = { a: number } & { a: string }
// Conflicting['a'] is evaluated to type `number & string`, which, is .......... `never`
```

We will talk more about the [problems with never](/ts/s01e05#empty-types) later on.

But for now just beware that, for example:

```js
type Conflicting = { a: number } & { a: string }

function returnConflict(): Conflicting {...}

const num: number = returnConflict().a // 👍🏻
// 🚨 type never is allowed to be assigned to whatever other type without verification 🚨
```

So when possible, prefer interfaces extensions or use with caution and double check intersections 😁
