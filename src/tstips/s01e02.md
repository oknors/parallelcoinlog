Sometimes we would like types to conditionally have different values, or have a broader type in an outer scope but a more fine grained one in an inner scope, this section is going to give you a bunch of examples on how to achieve that.

## Type Guards

From the [Handbook][type-guards-handbook]: Union types are useful for modelling overlaps but sometimes we will need to know specifics of what kind of data we are handling, and that's where Type Guards come in.

```js
type Fish = {
  swim: () => void,
}

type Bird = {
  fly: () => void,
}

const pet: Fish | Bird = getPet()

if (pet.fly) {
  // 👆🏻Property 'fly' does not exist on type 'Fish | Bird'.
  // Property 'fly' does not exist on type 'Fish'.ts(2339)
  pet.fly() // 💣💥
  // 👆🏻Property 'fly' does not exist on type 'Fish | Bird'.
  // Property 'fly' does not exist on type 'Fish'.ts(2339)
}
```

Type Guards are basically functions that narrow down the possibilities of a composed type (specially talking about Unions), allowing you to use properties such as `fly` above inside a scoped block, Type Guard functions use the reserved keyword `is` after one of the parameters name in the return type. And they always have to return a boolean (indicating if that parameter is that checked type or not), an example:

```js
const isBird = (pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Bird => {...}

const pet: Fish | Bird = getPet()

if (isBird(pet)) {
  pet.fly()
}
```

So this above compiles and works great! 💪🏻

There are multiple ways to implement the Type Guard functions and that will really depend on what kind of types you are trying to differentiate, but you should look for something that will be able to tell them apart, and sometimes you might need to use type casts.

For example:

```js
const isBird = (pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Bird => pet.hasOwnProperty('fly')
// that could work, but we are not exactly checking if fly is undefined or something,
// so it will really depend on how pet is initialized
const isBird = (pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Bird => 'fly' in pet
// same problem as above
// just trying to give examples without type casts
// because I know some people are very against them
function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
  return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}
// 👆🏻 but that's actually the official example in the handbook, using type casts
```

This can be very useful for [making "conversion" functions idempotent][idempotency-guard]

```js
const isNumber = (dt: Date | number): dt is number => typeof dt === 'number'

const convertDateToEpoch = (dt: Date | number) => {
  if (isNumber(dt)) {
    return dt
  } else {
    return dt.getTime()
    // the compiler will know that if dt is not a number, the only possible option is Date
    // therefore allowing you to use `dt.getTime`
    // which you wouldn't be able to outside the else scope
  }
}

const dt = new Date()
convertDateToEpoch(dt) === convertDateToEpoch(convertDateToEpoch(convertDateToEpoch(dt)))
// 👆🏻 returns true
```

Or it can also be very useful for verifying if optional parameters are defined

Spoiler alert, if you don't fully understand this example by now, don't worry, we are going to talk about [Generics](/ts/s01e04#generics) later

```js
const isDefined = <T>(p: T | undefined): p is T => p !== undefined

const optionalP = (p?: string) => {
  if (isDefined<string>(p)) {
    // do something with p as string
  } else {
    // do something else knowing that p is not defined
  }
}
```

## keyof

I would describe `keyof T` the types counterpart of `Object.keys(obj)` in JS.

So if you ever need to express this kind of relationship, you will need `keyof`, which will yield a Union of possible string values, therefore always a subtype of `string`.

Some examples from [the handbook][keyof-handbook]:

```js
interface Person {
  name: string
  age: number
  location: string
}

type K1 = keyof Person // "name" | "age" | "location"
type K2 = keyof Person[] // "length" | "push" | "pop" | "concat" | ...
type K3 = keyof { [x: string]: Person } // string
```

This can be useful for:

1. Restrict your API by setting a few possible options instead of allowing for `string`, so you can have more compile time errors and less runtime errors
2. Make your API smarter by inferring correct types based on the limited few options.

```js
const obj = { prop: 1, name: 'name' }
const getProperty: <T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K) => T[K] = (obj, key) => obj[key]

const n: number = getProperty(obj, 'prop') // 👍🏻 obj.prop is indeed number
const s: string = getProperty(obj, 'prop') // 💣💥 obj.prop is not string
// 👆🏻 Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.ts(2322)

getProperty(obj, 'bog') // 💣💥 obj.bog is not defined (bog is not keyof obj)
// 👆🏻 Argument of type '"bog"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"name" | "prop"'.ts(2345)

```

Again, if you are not comfortable with this example, you might be lacking information about [Extensions](/ts/s01e03#extends), [Inferences](/ts/s01e04#annotation-vs-inference) and/or [Generics](/ts/s01e04#generics), grab some more coffee, we will talk about those later. ☕️

## enum

Enum, short for Enumerated Type, it's common in many languages, it's basically a group of named constants.

"It's one of the few features TypeScript has which is not a type-level extension of JavaScript." [Reference][enum-handbook]

It behaves "ALMOST" like an object, with keys and values.

Enums are great, they can work both as type and logic 🎉 reducing the amount of code you have to write when you are dealing with limited number of options.

BUT, and it's indeed a BIG BUT 🍑, [numeric enums are hard and confusing to use][enum-suck], and I would go as far as to recommend you not to use them.

So why are we talking about enums if I'm recommending people not to use it ? 🤔

Because string enums are still great and can make your code shine, for example for declaring your [redux action types][redux-action-types]:

```js
export enum MapTypes {
  INIT_MAP = 'store.action.map.init',
  RECORD_COLAB_ROUTE = 'store.action.map.colab_route',
}
```

with this approach, combined with the [Companion Object](/ts/s01e04#companion-object) approach for MapActions, the [redux reducer][redux-reducer] can be quite lean, it works like magic 🎉🎉🎉

```js
export default (state = initialState, action: MapActions): MapState => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case MapTypes.INIT_MAP: {
      // action.payload type is correctly inferred from type guard for init_map type
      return { ...state, ...action.payload }
    }
    case MapTypes.RECORD_COLAB_ROUTE: {
      // action.payload type is correctly inferred from type guard for record_colab_route type
      return { ...state, ...action.payload }
    }
  }
}
```

## infer

`infer` is a funny Typescript keyword, which, by the way, I couldn't find any hit in the official documentation 🤷🏻‍♀️ I expected more from Microsoft 🤔

In my own humble words then, it allows you to `infer` the Generic Parameter of a given [Generic](/ts/s01e04#interfaces-vs-types), I'll give it an example, don't worry.

```js
const getNumber = async (): Promise<number> => 1

const x = getNumber() // x is of type = Promise<number>

type TryInfer<P> = P extends Promise<infer U> ? U : P
// if the type param is a promise return the resolved type of that promise
// if the type param is not a promise, return itself

const a: TryInfer<typeof x> = await x // 👍🏻
// so in this case, `typeof x` is `Promise<number>`
// therefore `TryInfer<typeof x>` was inferred to be `number`
// a is of type number

const b: TryInfer<typeof a> = 2 // 👍🏻
// so in this case, `typeof a` is `number`
// so there is nothing to infer, `TryInfer<typeof a>` is again `number`
// b is of type number
```

This can be used for all sorts of things, but I do use it, mainly in my API mocks constructor, to ensure the mocks have the same return type as it's own function definitions, very similar to what was presented on [ReturnType and Parameters](/ts/s01e01#returntype-and-parameters) example, but when talking about API mocks, those are usually async functions, so we do need to `Unpack` a promise and `infer` that response type.

```js
type UnpackPromise<T> = T extends Promise<infer U> ? U : T

export interface Resource {
  (params: any): Promise<any>
}

export type MockFactory<T extends Resource> = {
  (input?: Parameters<T>[0], output?: UnpackPromise<ReturnType<T>>): void
}

const func = async (p: string) => p.charCodeAt(0) + 300

const mockFac: MockFactory<typeof func> = (p, r) => {...}

mockFac('string', 1) // 👍🏻
mockFac('string', 'string') // 💣💥
// 👆🏻 Argument of type '"string"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.ts(2345)
```
